🚀 **Introducing the Salesforce MCP Server - Bridging AI and CRM Like Never Before!** 🤖

I'm excited to share an innovative open-source project that's revolutionizing how AI systems interact with Salesforce CRM data. The **Salesforce MCP Server** implements the standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP) directly within Salesforce using Apex.

✨ **What makes this special?**

🔹 **Seamless AI Integration**: Enables AI models to directly access and manipulate CRM data through standardized protocols
🔹 **Production Ready**: Built with Salesforce Apex, following enterprise security and best practices  
🔹 **Modular Architecture**: Extensible tools, resources, and prompts for various CRM operations
🔹 **Real-world Applications**: Lead management, product catalog access, code review automation
🔹 **Developer Friendly**: Comprehensive API with JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance

🎯 **Perfect for:**
- Sales teams looking to integrate AI assistants with their CRM workflows
- Developers building AI-powered Salesforce applications  
- Companies wanting to leverage LLMs for CRM data analysis and automation
- Organizations seeking standardized AI-CRM integration patterns

The project includes everything you need: complete Apex implementation, Python client for testing, and thorough documentation with usage examples.

This is the future of AI-CRM integration - making enterprise data accessible to AI systems while maintaining Salesforce's robust security model.
